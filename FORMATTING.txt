The .soduku format consists of plain, UTF-8 encoded text, visually mimicking the
usual layout of a Sudoku board. For example:

example.sudoku
            1 _ _ 2 1 _ _ _ _
            3 8 _ _ _ 7 4 1 _
            _ _ 2 _ 9 _ 7 5 2
            4 9 5 _ 2 _ _ 5 _
            _ _ 9 _ 3 4 3 _ _
            _ 3 1 _ 7 _ _ 6 _
            8 5 _ 7 _ _ _ _ 4
            _ _ 1 6 _ _ 5 _ 9
            _ 2 9 _ 1 6 _ 2 _


As is shown, each blank space is denoted by an underscore (`_`), and each
"square" is separated by a space. Digits are denotes normally.

The format is tolerant to the presence of whitespace; it is optional to have
whitespace between digits/underscores, and leading and trailing whitespace is
ignored.
